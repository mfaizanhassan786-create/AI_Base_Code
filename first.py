#       5 Simple Examples of Loops

# A loop means doing something again and again.
# Just like in real life — you brush your teeth
# EVERY day, you eat breakfast EVERY morning.
# That's a loop! Let's see some examples. 👇



# Example 1: Morning Routine ☀️
# Every morning you do the same tasks — wake up,
# brush teeth, take a shower, eat breakfast, go
# to school/work. A for loop does them one by one.


print("☀️ Example 1: My Morning Routine")
print()

    "Wake up from bed 🛏️",
    "Brush my teeth 🪥",
    "Take a shower 🚿",

]

step = 1
for task in morning_tasks:
    print(f"  Step {step}: {task}")
    step = step + 1

print("  ✅ Morning routine done! Ready for the day!")
print()


# Example 2: Counting My Shopping Bill 🛒
# You bought some items from a shop. Now you want
# to add up the prices one by one — just like a
# cashier does at the counter.

print("🛒 Example 2: Counting My Shopping Bill")
print()

    "Milk": 120,

    print(f"  🔹 {item_name} = Rs.{price}  (Running total: Rs.{total_bill})")

print(f"  💰 Total Bill: Rs.{total_bill}")
print()


# Example 3: Studying for Exams 📚
# You have 5 chapters to study. You study one
# chapter at a time. After each chapter, you

# Example 4: Waiter Taking Orders 🍽️
# A waiter goes table by table and takes each
